About the project: 
I wanted to create a chat space, where a user could pick a user name and a back ground for his/her chat window. Create/Join a list. And start a conversation. Once a chat room is in progress, I had intended to have a scrolling cards of users participating in the posts - the most recent 5 posts' authors would be displayed in a moving window.
